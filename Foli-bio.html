                <section>
                    <p>Hello everyone! and thanks for stopping by my page to check out my portfolio.
                    <br/> My name is Ross Joseph and I am a 'Jack of Many trades' which is said to be a master of none,
                    <br/> but a Jack of many trades is still better than a master of one.
                    <br/> I am an aspiring web developer that will eventually dive into game development and penetration testing as a career
                    <br/> This webpage alone is testament to my dedication, as i chose to seek the knowledge required at the very fundamental level
                    <br/> for both careers in the tech industry. As i continue to grow and sharpen my skills that'll be acquired, I will continue 
                    <br/> to add more content on my portfolio that will display my skills and slowly but surely evolve this page
                    <br/> to a popular sit that people will continue to check as i venture into the limelight i did not wish cast upon me</P>
