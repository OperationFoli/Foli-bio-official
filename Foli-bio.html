                <section>
                    <p>Hello everyone! and thanks for stopping by my page to check out my portfolio.</p>
                    <p>My name is Ross Joseph and I am a 'Jack of Many trades' which is said to be a master of none,</p>
                    <p>but a Jack of many trades is still better than a master of one.</p>
                    <p>I am an aspiring web developer that will eventually dive into game development and penetration testing as a career</p>
                    <p>This webpage alone is testament to my dedication, as i chose to seek the knowledge required at the very fundamental level</p>
                    <P>for both careers in the tech industry. As i continue to grow and sharpen my skills that'll be acquired, I will continue </P>
                    <p>to add more content on my portfolio that will display my skills and slowly but surely evolve this page</p>
                    <P>to a popular sit that people will continue to check as i venture into the limelight i did not wish cast upon me</P>

            <!-- PDF should go below this line above closing tag 'Section' -->
        </article>

        <section>

            <!-- these are links that are connected to gaming and programming page -->

        </section>

        <!-- This section is about the future of Foli and plans to evolve -->

        <section>
           <h2> What the future Bestowes</h2>
           <p>As i stated above, this page will continue to evolve for the better. Eventually, this page will be the future homepage of</p>
           'Foli Studios'!!!! I have a mock logo but it will be revised in order to suit my style.
           "Foli Studios" is going to be a renowned gaming company that will be participationg in gaming tournaments that are considered ESPORTS
           and will also be developing its own original game from scratch implementing ideas from anime physics and capabilities
           and incorporating them into a large scale open world game that can be flooded with players in a single lobby!!</p>
           <p>CHEATERS BE WARNED: Enjoy the exploits as you see fit but when judgement is passed we will remind you how much your avatar</p>
           will truly be pissed. A lobby designed specifically to cheaters will be created will have its own subquests and have permedeath mode activated.
           
           In conclusion, this Porttfolio will just be a sublink at some point to the official Foli studios page
